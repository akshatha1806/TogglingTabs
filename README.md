# TogglingTabs in SwiftUI

**TabView** is a view container that allows you to create a tab-based navigation interface. Each tab typically represents a separate view or content.
**LazyVGrid** is used to create a grid layout that only creates and renders the visible items, providing better performance for larger datasets.
